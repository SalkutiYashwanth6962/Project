            <h1 class="title" class="title">Privacy Policy</h1 class="sub-title">
			<p>Picktime (“Picktime”, “we”, or “us”) recognizes the importance of privacy. We want you to feel confident using our services, and this privacy policy
			(“Policy”) is to help you understand and describe how we collect, use, and disclose information that we obtain about users of our websites, services,
			plug-ins, software or other Downloadable Tools (all of which we refer to as the “Platform”).</p>
			
			<p>Throughout this document, we will use a few terms to describe various roles. Picktime Members have signed up to use our service and created an account. 
			Picktime Users are people who are scheduling with a Picktime Member and have not registered and created an account with us.</p>
		
			<h1 class="sub-title" class="sub-title">Information We Collect</h1 class="sub-title">
			<p>We collect information about you directly from you and automatically through your use of our Platform. We may combine information automatically collected
			with other information that we have collected about you.</p>
			
			<p>In order to help you protect yourself and your information, we encourage you to provide only that information that is necessary for using our Platform. 
			For example, to schedule a meeting you may only need to provide us with a name, email address, mobile number, date and time.</p>
		
			<h1 class="sub-title" class="sub-title">Information You Provide</h1 class="sub-title">
				<ul>
					<li class="legal-list">Information You Provide</li>
						<p>When a Picktime User comes to Picktime to schedule an event with a Picktime Member, you voluntarily give us certain information. This can include your name,
						email address and phone number; email addresses of other people; subject of the meeting; and any other information you provide us or as required by the 
						Picktime Member you are scheduling with.</p>
						
						<p>A Picktime Member may also connect their calendar with Picktime. Our calendar integration only checks the duration and free/busy status of the events
						in your calendar so that we do not book you when you're busy. We never know who you're meeting with, their email, the meeting title or any other 
						details about the appointments in your calendar.</p>
					
					<li class="legal-list">Account Information</li>
					<p>Picktime Members may give us permission to access their information in other services. For example, with your consent, you may link your Picktime account with your 
					Google, Microsoft Office 365 account, or other similar service, which allows us to obtain information from those accounts (like your basic profile or contacts).
					The information we get from those services often depends on your settings or their privacy policies, so be sure to check what those are</p>
			
					<li class="legal-list">Billing Information. </li>
					<p>If you purchase a premium version (once it is available) of Picktime, our third party payment processors will collect and store your billing address and credit card information.
					We store the last four digits of your credit card number and the expiration date.</p>	
				</ul>
		
			<h1 class="sub-title">Information Collected Automatically</h1 class="sub-title">
			<p>Like many websites, we and our service providers use cookies, web beacons and other technologies to receive and store certain types of information when you interact with us through your 
			computer or mobile device. Using these technologies helps us customize your experience with our Services, improve your experience, and make tailor marketing
			messages. Here are some of the types of information we collect:</p>
				<ul>
					<li class="legal-list">Log & Device data.</li>
						<p>When you use Picktime, our servers automatically record information (“log data”), including information that your browser sends whenever you visit our Website. This log data may
						include your web address you came from or are going to, your device model, operating system, browser type, unique device identifier, IP address, mobile network carrier, and time zone
						or location. Whether we collect some or all of this information often depends on what type of device you’re using and its settings. For 
						example, different types of information are available depending on whether you’re using a Mac or a PC, or an iPhone or an Android phone.
						To learn more about what information your device makes available to us, please check the policies of your device manufacturer or software
						provider..</p>
				</ul>
		
			<h1 class="sub-title">Cookies and Other Tracking Mechanisms</h1 class="sub-title">
				<ul>
					<li class="legal-list">Cookie data.</li>
						<p>Depending on how you’re accessing our products, we may use “cookies” (a small text file sent by your computer each time you visit our website, unique to your Picktime account or your browser)
						or similar technologies to record log data. When we use cookies, we may use “session” cookies (that last until you close your browser) or 
						“persistent” cookies (that last until you or your browser delete them). For example, we may use cookies to keep you logged in to Picktime.
						Some of the cookies we use are associated with your Picktime account (including personal information about you, such as the email address
						you gave us), and other cookies are not. To help us make e-mails more useful and interesting, we often receive a confirmation when you open
						e-mail from Picktime if your computer supports such capabilities. You can opt out of receiving emails from us. Please see the Your Choices
						section below.</p>
					<li class="legal-list">Other Web Site Analytics Services</li>
						<p>We use third party service providers such as Google Analytics, Mixpanel and Kissmetrics to provide certain analytics and user interactions
						services to Picktime in connection with our operation of our site, including the collection and tracking of certain data and information 
						regarding the characteristics and activities of visitors Picktime. You may opt-out of third party cookies from Google Analytics, Mixpanel 
						and Kissmetrics’ Opt-Out Feature on their respective websites. We do not currently recognize or respond to browser-initiated Do Not Track
						signals, as there is no consistent industry standard for compliance.</p>
