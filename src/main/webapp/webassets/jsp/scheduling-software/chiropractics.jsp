				<p>Whether you are a Chiropractor who runs a single staff business or a part of a much larger enterprise, there are unique challenges to the profession in regard to generating more revenue or more appointments. Smaller businesses often deal with constant uncertainty to make a decision based on the cost of hiring someone to help scheduling appointments. This process can be expensive and time-consuming. Businesses with more employees have a new set of problems altogether. How do you determine which client belongs with which Chiropractor? If you share a receptionist, is there a standard system for adding an appointment to each practitioner's schedule? As you can see, there are various challenges no matter the what the size or structure of your business is.</p>

		<h2 style="margin-bottom: 25px;">Benefits of Picktime for Chiropractors</h2>
		<div class="service-desc-block">
			<h3 class="service-desc-title">Stay on time</h3>
			<p> An easy to read appointment schedule is critical for keeping an office on track. With Picktime Appointment scheduler, you can view appointments schedules at-a-glance on screen or quickly print a report of the day&#39;s appointments. Sharing the scheduling information with more than one computer keeps all staff up-to-date.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="service-desc-block">
			<h3 class="service-desc-title">Avoid missed appointments or conflicts</h3>
			<p>Reduce the number of cancellations and no-shows by sending automatic email or text message reminders using our appointment reminder option.  Also, you can avoid double booking and appointment overlapping.</p>
		</div>
	    <div class="service-desc-block">
		    <h3 class="service-desc-title">Improve communication with staff and with patients</h3>
			<p>With all the information on your computer or mobile screen, you will be able to concentrate on serving the patient's needs. You can quickly change appointments, reschedule them and update patient information. You can email appointment booking details to providers so they can stay informed.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="service-desc-block">  
			<h3 class="service-desc-title">Get Updated</h3>
			<p>Yes, some larger chiropractic center is still using paper documents as part of business processes, especially in appointment scheduling. Hard to believe, but old ways died. The problem with paper bookings is, of course, they can be damaged, lost, or stolen. There&#39;s no way to encrypt a piece of paper to protect the privacy of your patients and staffs. And there&#39;s no way to update that paper from an office on the other side of the country or any other location. Managing schedules and customer data online is faster, more secure, and much more reliable.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="service-desc-block">  
			<h3 class="service-desc-title">Save resources and Money</h3>
			<p>A major issue with manual bookings is keeping multiple copies of appointment schedules in multiple locations, which can lead to confusion and inaccuracy. Storing customer data, schedules, and employee profiles online eliminates the risk of outdated records being shared due to repetition. With our online booking software, you save a lot of time, Money and use your time for more valuable things.</p>
