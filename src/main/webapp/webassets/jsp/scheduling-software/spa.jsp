				<p>Maintaining a spa industry is not a piece of cake. The Spa Industry has risen so much in the past 15 years that it has become a necessity for most of the people. With increasing stress levels and extremely busy daily lives, people tend to see spaâ€™s as their only getaways for a relaxing hour or two. A good massage or treatment in your spa might just brighten the mood of your customer. With challenging  tasks in hand, interfering customers and constant telephone ringing can sidetrack your concentration resulting in poor service and unhappy customers. Catering to all your customers and Managing appointments does become crazier as your customer base keeps growing.

			<h3 class="service-desc-title">Managing Appointment Schedules</h3>
			<p>In Today&#39;s fast moving world, customers expect prompt answers from their spa operators. If they do not get it in touch quickly, without any
			intervening time they start searching for a new place. So, if you want to keep your customers and win new ones, you have come to the right place.</p>

		<div class="service-desc-block">
			<h3 class="service-desc-title">Let your customers make bookings with their favourite Therapist</h3>
			<p>It is quite common to see disappointed customers when they hear that their favourite therapist is not available. This often leads to loosing of customers.
			   With picktime, you can let your staff manage their own schedules which results in a better working environment and happy customers.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="service-desc-block">
		    <h3 class="service-desc-title">Appointment Booking Redefined</h3>
			<p>The appointment booking process for many spa centers is not as simple as it seems. Most often it's quite a hassle that requires a lot of time and staff resources to properly manage.

			   for people scheduling, as they may not have the way to contact the spa during other than normal operating hours&#45;it also equates to missed sales when they are closed. As our scheduling software is internet based you can use it anytime and anywhere.</p>
