		<h2 style="margin-bottom: 25px;">Benefits of Picktime for Sports Equipment Rental:</h2>
		<div class="service-desc-block">
			<h3 class="service-desc-title">Equipment Management</h3>
			<p>Clients can reserve beforehand and be sure they get the equipment when they need it. You can track your sports equipment and know how many items are already reserved. You can verify who booked an item by asking for a confirmation email/SMS or by simply checking personal data. You can organize the process better, by putting the exact duration for which you rent an item.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="service-desc-block">
			<h3 class="service-desc-title">Rent More Equipment</h3>
			<p>Our online booking system will help you grow your equipment rental business through capturing online shoppers. When an online shopper books their appointment through your website they are done shopping, they are now your customer! Without online scheduling, your website simply can't rent your equipment online. Turn your website into a powerful sales tool capable of making sales on the spot. It also reduces the workload of your staff.</p>
