				<p>While patient growth certainly has its benefits, it also creates new difficulties for Physiologists and their staff. Processes and methods that previously were adequate may no longer be effective in handling a rise in patients, urging administrators to seek out alternatives and new technology and techniques to assist them and their patients. One process that almost immediately resulted in an increase in patients is appointment scheduling. This seemingly simple task can often become burdensome and challenging to staff members. This is especially true if the Physiologists facility continues to rely on the most standard and also the most inefficient manner of scheduling appointments over the phone.</p>
				<p>Picktime, an online appointment scheduling system, allows individuals to conveniently and securely book their appointments with Physiologists online through any Web-connected device. They can typically access Picktime through a “Book Now” button found on your website or page, or from an URL provided to them by the Physiologists. You appointments get automatically booked without any staff interaction needed. In addition to online scheduling, Picktime also comes equipped with other beneficial features like automated e-mail and text message reminders, which the system sends out to patients and booked individuals on a specific date prior to their scheduled appointment.</p>
				<p>Securing your information is our number one priority. Your data is backed up automatically and kept in ultra-secure facilities. Picktime is a robust Physiologist appointment scheduling software that is so easy to use. Take your practice to the next level, Picktime is the perfect application for all hospitals and doctor offices even if you are a one-man army or if you have multiple locations and multiple staff members. Allow your clients to schedule an appointment at their own convenience, remember that 60% of online bookings are made outside of office hours!</p>
