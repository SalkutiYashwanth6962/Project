	</ul>
	
	<h3>Order Submission</h3>
	<p>When the User submits an order, the following applies:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>The submission of an order determines contract conclusion and therefore creates for the User the obligation to pay the price, taxes and possible further fees and expenses, as specified on the order page.</li>
	<li>In case the purchased Product requires active input from the User, such as the provision of personal information or data, specifications or special wishes, the order submission creates an obligation for the User to cooperate accordingly.</li>

	</ul>
	
	<p>All notifications related to the described purchasing process shall be sent to the email address provided by the User for such purposes.</p>

	<ul>
	<li>either exclusive or inclusive of any applicable fees, taxes and costs, depending on the section the User is browsing.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>The Owner may offer discounts or provide special offers for the purchase of Products. Any such offer or discount shall always be subject to the eligibility criteria and the terms and conditions set out in the corresponding section of www.picktime.com.</p>
	
	<p>Offers and discounts are always granted at the Owner’s sole discretion.</p>
	
	<p>Repeated or recurring offers or discounts create no claim/title or right that Users may enforce in the future.</p>
	
	<p>Depending on the case, discounts or offers shall be valid for a limited time only or while stocks last. If an offer or discount is limited by time, the time indications refer to the time zone of the Owner, as indicated in the Owner’s location details in this document, unless otherwise specified.</p>
	<h3>Coupons</h3>
	<p>Offers or discounts can be based on Coupons.</p>
	
	<p>If breach of the conditions applicable to Coupons occurs, the Owner can legitimately refuse to fulfill its contractual obligations and expressly reserves the right to take appropriate legal action to protect its rights and interests.</p>

	<li>A Coupon may only be applied, in its entirety, at the actual time of purchase – partial use is not permitted;</li>

	<li>A Coupon cannot be applied cumulatively;</li>
	<li>The Coupon must be redeemed exclusively within the time specified in the offer. After this period, the Coupon will automatically expire, precluding any possibility for the User to claim the relevant rights, including cash-out;</li>
	<li>The User is not entitled to any credit/refund/compensation if there is a difference between the value of the Coupon and the redeemed value;</li>
	<li>The Coupon is intended solely for non–commercial use. Any reproduction, counterfeiting and commercial trade of the Coupon is strictly forbidden, along with any illegal activity related to the purchase and/or use of the Coupon.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h3>Methods Of Payment</h3>
	<p>Information related to accepted payment methods are made available during the purchasing process.</p>
	
	<p>Some payment methods may only be available subject to additional conditions or fees. In such cases related information can be found in the dedicated section of www.picktime.com.</p>
	<p>All payments are independently processed through third-party services. Therefore, www.picktime.com does not collect any payment information – such as credit card details – but only receives the last four digits of the credit card and a notification once the payment has been successfully completed.</p>
	
	<p>If payment through the available methods fail or is refused by the payment service provider, the Owner shall be under no obligation to fulfil the purchase order. Any possible costs or fees resulting from the failed or refused payment shall be borne by the User.</p>
	<h3>Authorization For Future PayPal Payment</h3>
	<p>If Users authorize the PayPal feature which allows future purchases, www.picktime.com will store an identification code linked to the Users’ PayPal account. This will authorize www.picktime.com to automatically process payments for future purchases or recurring installments of past purchases.</p>

	<p>Nothing in these Terms excludes, restricts or modifies any guarantee, condition, warranty, right or remedy which the User may have under the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 (Cth) or any similar State and Territory legislation and which cannot be excluded, restricted or modified (non-excludable right). To the fullest extent permitted by law, our liability to the User, including liability for a breach of a non-excludable right and liability which is not otherwise excluded under these Terms of Use, is limited, at the Owner’s sole discretion, to the re-performance of the services or the payment of the cost of having the services supplied again.</p>

	<h4>US Users</h4>
	<p>Any such invalid or unenforceable provision will be interpreted, construed and reformed to the extent reasonably required to render it valid, enforceable and consistent with its original intent.

	In case of failure to do so, the void, invalid or unenforceable provisions shall be replaced by the applicable statutory provisions, if so permitted or stated under the applicable law.</p>
	<p>Without prejudice to the above, the nullity, invalidity or the impossibility to enforce a particular provision of these Terms shall not nullify the entire Agreement, unless the severed provisions are essential to the Agreement, or of such importance that the parties would not have entered into the contract if they had known that the provision would not be valid, or in cases where the remaining provisions would translate into an unacceptable hardship on any of the parties.</p>
