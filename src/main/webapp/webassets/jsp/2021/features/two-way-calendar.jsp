				<p>Do you have personal meetings that sync with your google or apple calendar? Sync your favourite account with your Picktime account and you are all set.</p>
				<p>Now donâ€™t worry about your personal meetings and appointments clashing with your business appointments. With the two-way calendar sync we help you book in your customers around your personal schedule. Stop worrying about meetings and concentrate on do doing what you love the most.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="feature_sec">
				<h2>How it works?</h2>
				<p>Imagine you have your friends birthday party you have to be at on a particular day. With the Two-way calendar sync Picktime takes the information from your google calendar and blocks of that particular time in your Picktime Calendar. So that particular time-slot gets blocked everywhere even in your booking page. It not just blocks the time, If you reschedule an event or appointment in one calendar, it automatically gets updated in the other.</p>
