				<p>You can automatically send feedback requests to your clients and customers after an appointment ends to get ratings on your services and staff. In addition, you may request ratings in numbers from your customers. Ask them to put forth their opinion on your services, the efficiency of your employees, availability of resources, and the overall ambiance.
				</p>
				<p>Customer experience is a driving force of your business. Make sure that you highlight them to build trust and credibility for your business. For example, if you are a doctor or a lawyer, good client experiences and reviews will act as word-of-mouth and help you get more clients.</p>
