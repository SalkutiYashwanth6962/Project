	        	<P>Is one of your staff free for that day? With picktime, you can automatically assign a service to that staff. When an appointment is booked, Picktime not only adds the appointment to your business calendar, it also adds it to the personal calendar of your staff. So you donâ€™t have to worry about calling him and keep reminding him of his appointments if your business provides services on the go.</P>

			<div class="feature_sec">
	       		 <P>Picktime not only lets you choose the permissions you give to your staff. Easily manage schedules and even better let them manage their schedules themselves.</P>

			<div class="feature_sec">
	       		 <P>Automatically generate reports. Know which staff has provided the best service for that particular week or month. This not only gives you better insights about your staff but also helps your reward them anyway possible. What are you still waiting for? Join on board for free.</P>
