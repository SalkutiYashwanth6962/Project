		        <P>Is one of your staff free for that day? With picktime, you can automatically assign a service to that staff. When an appointment is booked, Picktime not only adds the appointment to your business calendar, it also adds it to the personal calendar of your staff. So you donâ€™t have to worry about calling him and keep reminding him of his appointments if your business provides services on the go.</P>

				<div id="feature_sec">
		        <P>Picktime not only lets you choose the permissions you give to your staff. Easily manage schedules and even better let them manage their schedules themselves.</P>
				</div>
				<div id="feature_sec">
		        <P>Automatically generate reports. Know which staff has provided the best service for that particular week or month.
