		    <h1 class="text-center">GDPR Compliance Statement</h1>
		    <p>The Picktime GDPR Compliance Statement is aimed towards making our users understand the nitty-gritty of the GDPR and how we are complying with it</p>
		    <h3>What is GDPR?</h3>
		    <p>An abbreviation for the General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679, GDPR, is a European Union regulation designed for the protection of privacy and data in the European Union and the European Economic Area. This privacy law was implemented on 25th May 2018, even though it was made two years back on 14th April 2016 by the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union. The law also looks after the collection, usage, retention and transfer of personal data outside the European Union and the European Economic Area.</p>
		    <p>The GDPR allows the residents of the European Union to have greater control over their data and builds greater customer trust and credibility of businesses.</p>
		    <p>Read more about the GDPR and the approach of the European Commission towards the protection of data and privacy of residents of the European Union on their official<a href="https://gdpr.eu/what-is-data-processing-agreement/"> website.</a></p>  
		    <h3>Who does the GDPR affect?</h3>
		    <p>The GDPR regulates residents as well as institutions and corporations, both inside and outside the European Union and the European Economic Area, which interact and engage in business activities with such residents online or monitor and track their web activities. </p>
		    <h3>What is personal data?</h3>
		    <p>The term “personal data” has been defined in Article 4 (1) of the GDPR as any information related to an identified or identifiable natural person (Data Subject). A natural person is identified directly or indirectly through identifiers such as their name, an identification number, location and any other characteristic which signifies their physical, mental, social, cultural or commercial identity. For example, mobile numbers, account numbers, credit card numbers and physical addresses are all considered personal data.</p>
		    <p>The law also states that the regulation for data protection only applies to information about any natural person and not to the information regarding any legal entities like an institution, a foundation or a corporation. Any natural person has the legal capacity to acquire the protection of their data on birth and loses it upon his or her death.</p>
		    <h3>How is Picktime complying with GDPR?</h3>
		    <p>Picktime understands the need for privacy and data protection. Therefore, we want our users to trust our privacy policy and be confident about using our services for which we are elaborately discussing how information about Picktime users is collected from our various platforms such as our website, services, plug-ins, software and other Downloadable Tools, and how do we use and disclose that information.</p>
			<p>After a careful review of how we store, use and manage the personal data of our users, we have made several amendments in our privacy policy and terms of use in compliance with the GDPR Law. We have made all the updated policies available on our website for our users and visitors.</p>

							<h3>Our New Privacy Policy tells you the source and the purpose of tracking your data</h3>
							<p>The updated Picktime <a href="/legal/privacy">Privacy Policy</a> complying with the GDPR incorporates details about how we collect personal information about our users and through which services or “Platforms”. Our Platforms include our website, services, plug-ins, software and other Downloadable Tools. We have also integrated with various external platforms such as Google, Microsoft Outlook, Apple App Store, PayPal, Zapier, Disqus, Zendesk and many more for tracking personal data of Picktime users such as name, city, country, physical address and postal code, email address and mobile number. Additionally, we have laid down the purpose of using that information to maintain transparency about our operations with our users.</p>

				             <h3>You can control the amount of information we collect about you</h3>
				             <p>Picktime collects information about its users through direct interaction with them. Information is also gathered automatically by Picktime whenever a user uses our Platform and then the information from both the sources is combined to obtain a complete piece of information.</p>
				             <p>We are concerned about the safety and security of our users. Hence, we request them to only provide information that is mandatory for using any of our Platforms. That will allow them to have greater control over the data that is being collected by us. Take, for example, if a user wishes to schedule a meeting, he or she may only require providing us with their name, email address, mobile number and the date and time of the meeting.</p>

						 	<p>A Picktime user voluntarily provides us information while scheduling a meeting or an appointment which can be their name, mobile number, email address, location and the email addresses of the other attendees of the meeting.
						 	</p>
						 	<p>Users are also allowed to integrate their other calendars such as Google Calendar, Outlook, Microsoft Exchange or Apple Calendars so that we can check the duration and status of the meeting or appointment. However, we do not track or monitor other information such as the names and email addresses of attendees of the meeting or any other details about the meeting in your Google Calendar, Outlook, Microsoft Exchange or Apple Calendars.

These technologies are also known as “Trackers”. These Trackers are directly managed by the Owner and are known as First-Party Trackers. Additionally, Picktime also makes use of trackers that enable services provided by a third party.
		              		</p>
		              		<p>For some specific purposes, the users might also be asked for consent for sharing their personal information. However, even after consent is given, it can be withdrawn freely at any time. This has been done specifically in consideration of the GDPR so that the personal information of any user is not disclosed with any third-party tracker.</p>

		              		</h3>
		              		<p>We use “technical trackers” for carrying out activities that are mandatory for the operation and delivery of our services. Session Storage permits Picktime to store and access data in a user’s browser but this data gets automatically deleted when the session ends i.e. when the browser tab is closed by the user. Apart from that, using Preference Cookies help Picktime detect and store user preferences such as the time zone and location of the user.
		              		</p>
		              		<p>The information about the validity and expiry date of Cookies and other similar trackers vary and depend upon the lifetime set by the Owner or the relevant provider.</p>

		    <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
		    <p>The following are some frequently asked questions about the changes in the terms and conditions of use of Picktime and the responsibilities and liabilities of the Picktime users as well as the owner.</p>
		    <h3>How to ensure safe registration at Picktime?</h3>
		    <p>To use our services, a user has to register by creating an account and provide complete and truthful information. The users are responsible for keeping their login credentials safe and confidential and therefore we recommend them to use a password that meets the highest standard of security as permitted by Picktime. The users will hold complete responsibility for the activities occurring in their account under their username and password. Also, note that any product subscription is renewed automatically by Picktime.</p>
		    <h3>How to terminate my account?</h3>
		    <p>In case a user wishes to terminate their account and stop using a service, they can seek help from the tools provided for account termination on our website or they may directly contact the owner.</p>
		    <h3>What if my personal data is disclosed?</h3>
		    <p>Please note that in case a user feels that their personal data has been unduly disclosed, stolen or their privacy has been violated, they will need to contact the owner immediately and unambiguously.
		       In case you have a query or wish to complain against a privacy breach, email us at legal@picktime.com.
		    </p>
		    <h3>What are the exclusive rights of the owner regarding the maintenance of the account?</h3>
		    <ul>
		     <li>The owner has the right to suspend or terminate a user’s account at any time and without notice if the user violates the Terms and Conditions or harms the owner, any other user or third parties.
		     </li>
		     <li>If an account of a user gets suspended or deleted, they will not be entitled to any claims for compensation or reimbursement.
		     </li>
		     <li>Violation of laws and regulations will result in legal action taken against the user. If the user is found guilty, he or she will not be exempted from paying any applicable fees or price.</li>
		    </ul>
		    <h3>Do I need to sign a Data Processing Addendum (DPA) with Picktime?</h3>
		    <p>If you are a resident of the European Union or the European Economic Area, you will need to sign a Data Processing Addendum (DPA) with Picktime, which is a contract between the data processor and the data controller under the rules laid down by the GDPR. You can request the DPA with our data processing officer at legal@picktime.com</p>
		    <h3>Does using Picktime make me comply with the GDPR?</h3>
		   <p>Remember that in this case, Picktime is the data processor but you are the data controller. We have put in our best efforts to make sure you and your business are GDPR compliant. But ultimately, as the data controller, it is your responsibility to let us know the amount of personal data you are willing to share with your clients and customers.</p>
