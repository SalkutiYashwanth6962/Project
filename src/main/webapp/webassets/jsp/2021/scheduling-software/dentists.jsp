				<p>The modern dental practice has developed drastically over the
					past few years. Most dentists use ledger cards and paper
					appointment books to track the appointments and financial health of
					the practice. There are several types of softwares that dentists
					use in their office, but the most important is the Appointment
					Scheduling software. One process that almost immediately increases
					the number of patients is appointment scheduling. This seemingly
					simple task can quickly become burdensome and challenging to many.
					While patient growth absolutely has its benefits, it also creates
					new difficulties for facility administrators and their staffs.</p>
