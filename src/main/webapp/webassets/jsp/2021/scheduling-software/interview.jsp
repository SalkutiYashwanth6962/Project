				<p>Interviews are a vital part of the hiring process, and also one of the most logistically challenging. Putting together an interview schedule that works for everyone is hard enough. And when you consider the possibility of going back and forth on email threads that don't talk to your interview scheduling software, the challenge just compounds. When your job is dedicated to finding the right candidate for the job, managing the troubles that come with bookings can be a total pain. Whether you are scheduling interviews or screening calls, you're required to find that magical time slot that works for everyone involved. Scheduling interviews is  time consuming task which involves proper management of staff and resources. You might have wondered, “How can I reduce the time I spend scheduling interviews, calls or rooms?” It’s easier than you think!</p>

				<p>With Picktime interview scheduling software, spend more time with your candidates and less time in interview scheduling. Picktime is a free online appointment booking software that can be used to schedule interviews and manage your staffs. Email threads trying to book a large number of appointments can quickly become confusing and trying to mark off available and booked time slots on a piece of paper is not favorable for improvements and changes to plans. If you are interviewing multiple applicants during a day or a few days then what you would want to do is mark these particular days as available for the interview and then give your Picktime business page link to your candidates. Applicants will only be able to book in the time frame that you allowed, they will select a time and the interview will be automatically booked. As soon as a slot is booked by one candidate it will not be available anymore to other candidates. In this case, everything is happening automatically and your calendar gets filled up with appointments without any further action on your part.</p>
