				<p>Usually, a couple of times a year parents (and often child as well) will have the opportunity to have meeting with the teacher and talk about the learning progress of their child. Have you ever noticed just how stressful a parent-teacher meeting really is? Parents often automatically think that the teacher is out to get their children. The teacher almost always thinks that parents have it in for them. Well the children mostly are caught in the middle and think that everyone is out to get them. Reduce this stress by taking some time to begin organizing for a parent-teacher meeting. By preparing yourself beforehand, you can help ensure that everything goes a lot smoother for everyone involved. An easy solution to this problem is to set up a Parents Teacher meeting scheduling software such as Picktime.</p>

				<h2>Benefits of Picktime for Parent Meetings</h2>
				<div id="services_sec">
					<h3>Improve efficiency without hassles</h3>
		        	<p>With Picktime's reliable and user-friendly system, the school administration can easily set meeting dates and times, specify teacher schedules and location as well as block out specified time slots. Most importantly, the administration no longer needs to be directly involved in scheduling meetings. Parents can easily select the available times most convenient for them, with an error-free meeting schedule practically built on its own.</p>
				</div>
				<div id="services_sec">
					<h3>Increase Parent Involvement</h3>
			        <p>To successfully educate students, cooperation between teachers and parents is an absolute must. To this end, schools are required to have Parent-Teacher meeting. However, with parents busier than ever, scheduling meetings with teachers has become more of a challenge. This is especially true when parents face the tedious task of filling out forms, calling secretaries and arranging meetings with various teachers. Picktime directly addresses these issues by offering parents an easy-to-use online scheduling system. With full visibility of all available meeting times for teachers and teams, scheduling convenient times becomes a breeze for parents. This secure system also prevents scheduling errors and ensures that conflicting appointments cannot be made. Whether parents have one or more child in school, Picktime's online scheduling will improve parent satisfaction and participation.</p>
				</div>
				<div id="services_sec">
					<h3>Helping Teachers</h3>
			        <p>Parent Meetings should be an opportunity for parents and teachers to cooperate in furthering the education of the students. However, when teachers are required to deal with parents changing their appointments and remind those that have not yet scheduled, they will likely feel worn out and stressed by the time the meeting rolls around. This all changes when schools use Picktime. With the administration setting the meeting dates and times and parents scheduling their own meetings, teachers will hardly need to get involved in building the Meeting schedule. With easy online access to view real-time changes to their personal schedule as well as other intuitive management features, teachers can focus on their real job in educating their students and collaborating with parents.</p>
				</div>
				<div id="services_sec">
					<h3>Book Now Widget</h3>
			         <p>Your Picktime account comes with Book Now Widget Embed code which you can place on your website to accept parent meeting bookings. Parents can book their meeting appointments without leaving your website. If you don't have a website, then picktime provides you a unique booking page which you can customize and add logo then it will be your business page to accept meeting bookings.</p>
