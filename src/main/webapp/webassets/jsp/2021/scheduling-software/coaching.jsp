				<h2>Benefits of Picktime for Coaching Centers or Individuals</h2>
				<div class="services_sec">
					<h3>A Better System to Manage Your Coaching & Tuition Classes</h3>
					<p>Time to dump those excel sheets and register books. Now
						manage your classes with Picktime. The simple and free class
						scheduling system that has everything you need to manage your
						Tuition Classes and Coaching Institute.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="services_sec">
					<h3>Recurring Classes</h3>
					<p>Coaching Services generally requires systematic recurring
						classes for a period of time in order to progress. With the help
						of Picktime, your students do not have to click twelve times to
						sign up for each class three times a week for a month. You can
						simply pick the days when the classes are available and set the
						number of recurring days. This way you can easily offer your
						students a package subscription for any of your classes.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="services_sec">
					<h3>Automatic Reminders</h3>
					<p>You and your students are busy with work and personal life.
						And to be honest, keeping all tasks and appointments in mind or
						running around with a register book at all times is challenging.
						Email and SMS reminders before classes will help your students to
						prepare themselves before training. In addition, automatic
						reminders are an exceptional solution for you to reduce student
						no-shows! Picktime also sends automatic reminders to each
						instructor and students so that they won't forget that they have a
						class.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="services_sec">
					<h3>Individual schedules for trainers/ coaches/ instructors</h3>
					<p>Managing individual schedules for each coach requires a lot
						of time that can easily be fixed with Picktime. All you need to do
						is to enter the class schedule of each trainer in the system and
						the calendar will automatically show their availability to
						students. Furthermore, you can give your trainers restricted
						access to the admin section so that they can manage their own
						working hours and bookings without seeing other instructor's
						schedules.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="services_sec">
					<h3>Avoid Double Bookings</h3>
					<p>Set the maximum size for each service providers, limiting
						the number of bookings that can be made at the same time. Set
						availability of service provider for group classes by mentioning
						the number of students per class. The slot will be blocked once
						the booking capacity reaches its limits.</p>
