				<p>Embassies and consulates around the world are affording various services for immigrants of their countries, who are usually visiting or staying abroad. Often, the staffs of these embassies are under a huge pressure from people who need help such as renewing passports, advice on legal stuff, traveling visa process or other business resolutions. Within the embassies, there are usually various consultants focusing on different problems, accepting appointments and helping people with their issues. Throughout the years, the scheduling of these bookings and meetings have been done over the phone, which unfortunately is not a very efficient way for the people nor the employees.</p>
			</div>
			<div id="services_sec">
				<p>The Picktime appointment software suits both the embassies and the consulates perfectly, because it helps to organize both your appointments and staffs of your business. The services can be split into different categories with many consultants. Each of the consultants can then have their own working hours schedule, which can be adjusted and tracked directly even from the smartphone as Picktime is a browser based appointment scheduling software. If the embassy or consulate has special days closed, they can set all employees off in such occasions. It will reduce your productivity loss, no-shows, and stress. Keep a record of customers and staffs, so that complaints or praises can be credited to the appropriate staff.</p>
			</div>
			<div id="services_sec">
				<p>Picktime for consulates is a great way to manage your appointments. If you are doing your scheduling by hand then it is easy to make mistakes. It allows for the automated appointment reminders via email or text message. Picktime appointment booking software enables paperless procedure workflows, as well as online contact data storage.
