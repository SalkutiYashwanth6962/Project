					<p>Whether you are a Chiropractor who runs a single staff
						business or a part of a much larger enterprise, there are unique
						challenges to the profession in regard to generating more revenue
						or more appointments. Smaller businesses often deal with constant
						uncertainty to make a decision based on the cost of hiring someone
						to help scheduling appointments. This process can be expensive and
						time-consuming. Businesses with more employees have a new set of
						problems altogether. How do you determine which client belongs with
						which Chiropractor? If you share a receptionist, is there a
						standard system for adding an appointment to each practitioner's
						schedule? As you can see, there are various challenges no matter
						the what the size or structure of your business is.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="services_sec">
					<p>Picktime can offer a solution to all these challenges.

						wasted time, that could easily be automated. Picktime is designed
						to make your office less stressful, more efficient, and (most
						importantly) more profitable. Picktime is a free web based
						appointment scheduling software which is easily accessible.

						helps you have a more profitable business and reduce your stress
						levels, too.</p>

					<h2>Benefits of Picktime for Chiropractors</h2>
					<div class="services_sec">
						<h3>Stay on time</h3>
						<p>An easy to read appointment schedule is critical for keeping
							an office on track. With <a href="/" target="_blank">Picktime Appointment scheduler,</a> you can
							view appointments schedules at-a-glance on screen or quickly print
							a report of the day&#39;s appointments. Sharing the scheduling
							information with more than one computer keeps all staff
							up-to-date.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="services_sec">
						<h3>Avoid missed appointments or conflicts</h3>
						<p>Reduce the number of cancellations and no-shows by sending
							automatic email or text message reminders using our appointment
							reminder option. Also, you can avoid double booking and
							appointment overlapping.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="services_sec">
						<h3>Improve communication with staff and with patients</h3>
						<p>With all the information on your computer or mobile screen,
							you will be able to concentrate on serving the patient's needs.
							You can quickly change appointments, reschedule them and update
							patient information. You can email appointment booking details to
							providers so they can stay informed.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="services_sec">
						<h3>Get Updated</h3>
						<p>Yes, some larger chiropractic center is still using paper
							documents as part of business processes, especially in appointment
							scheduling. Hard to believe, but old ways died. The problem with
							paper bookings is, of course, they can be damaged, lost, or
							stolen. There&#39;s no way to encrypt a piece of paper to protect
							the privacy of your patients and staffs. And there&#39;s no way to
							update that paper from an office on the other side of the country
							or any other location. <a href="/features/manage-customers" target="_blank">Managing schedules and customer data</a> online
							is faster, more secure, and much more reliable.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="services_sec">
						<h3>Save resources and Money</h3>
						<p>A major issue with manual bookings is keeping multiple
							copies of appointment schedules in multiple locations, which can
							lead to confusion and inaccuracy. Storing customer data,
							schedules, and employee profiles online eliminates the risk of
							outdated records being shared due to repetition. With our online
							booking software, you save a lot of time, money and use your time
							for more valuable things.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="services_sec">
						<p>Many Chiropractors can profit from the implementation of
							Picktime on many levels. To avail Picktime, simply sign up with your
							contact information and begin customizing your account. Make the
							first step to an entirely new way of doing business today.</p>
