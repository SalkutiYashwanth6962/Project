				<p>Whether you are a Chiropractor who runs a single staff
					business or a part of a much larger enterprise, there are unique
					challenges to the profession in regard to generating more revenue
					or more appointments. Smaller businesses often deal with constant
					uncertainty to make a decision based on the cost of hiring someone
					to help scheduling appointments. This process can be expensive and
					time-consuming. Businesses with more employees have a new set of
					problems altogether. How do you determine which client belongs with
					which Chiropractor? If you share a receptionist, is there a
					standard system for adding an appointment to each practitioner's
					schedule? As you can see, there are various challenges no matter
					the what the size or structure of your business is.</p>
			</div>
			<div id="services_sec">
				<p>Picktime can offer a solution to all these challenges at a
					free of cost. That staggering number of appointments hold a lot of
					wasted time, that could easily be automated. Picktime is designed
					to make your office less stressful, more efficient, and (most
					importantly) more profitable. Picktime is a free web based
					appointment scheduling software which is easily accessible.
					Picktime automates the things that are slowing down your office and

				<h2>Benefits of Picktime for Chiropractors</h2>
				<div id="services_sec">
					<h3>Stay on time</h3>
					<p>An easy to read appointment schedule is critical for keeping
						an office on track. With Picktime Appointment scheduler, you can
						view appointments schedules at-a-glance on screen or quickly print
						a report of the day&#39;s appointments. Sharing the scheduling
						information with more than one computer keeps all staff
						up-to-date.</p>
				</div>
				<div id="services_sec">
					<h3>Avoid missed appointments or conflicts</h3>
					<p>Reduce the number of cancellations and no-shows by sending
						automatic email or text message reminders using our appointment
						reminder option. Also, you can avoid double booking and
						appointment overlapping.</p>
				</div>
				<div id="services_sec">
					<h3>Improve communication with staff and with patients</h3>
					<p>With all the information on your computer or mobile screen,
						you will be able to concentrate on serving the patient's needs.
						You can quickly change appointments, reschedule them and update
						patient information. You can email appointment booking details to
						providers so they can stay informed.</p>
				</div>
				<div id="services_sec">
					<h3>Get Updated</h3>
					<p>Yes, some larger chiropractic center is still using paper
						documents as part of business processes, especially in appointment
						scheduling. Hard to believe, but old ways died. The problem with
						paper bookings is, of course, they can be damaged, lost, or
						stolen. There&#39;s no way to encrypt a piece of paper to protect
						the privacy of your patients and staffs. And there&#39;s no way to
						update that paper from an office on the other side of the country
						or any other location. Managing schedules and customer data online
						is faster, more secure, and much more reliable.</p>
				</div>
				<div id="services_sec">
					<h3>Save resources and Money</h3>
					<p>A major issue with manual bookings is keeping multiple
						copies of appointment schedules in multiple locations, which can
						lead to confusion and inaccuracy. Storing customer data,
						schedules, and employee profiles online eliminates the risk of
						outdated records being shared due to repetition. With our online
						booking software, you save a lot of time, Money and use your time
						for more valuable things.</p>
				</div>

				<div id="services_sec">
					<p>Many Chiropractors can profit from the implementation of
						Picktime on many levels. The benefits are more, while the cost is
						completely free. To avail Picktime, Simply sign up with your
						contact information and begin customizing your account. Make the
						first step to an entirely new way of doing business today.</p>
