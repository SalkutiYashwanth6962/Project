				<p>While patient growth certainly has its benefits, it also
					creates new difficulties for Physiologists and their staff.
					Processes and methods that previously were adequate may no longer
					be effective in handling a rise in patients, urging administrators
					to seek out alternatives and new technology and techniques to
					assist them and their patients. One process that almost immediately
					resulted in an increase in patients is appointment scheduling. This
					seemingly simple task can often become burdensome and challenging
					to staff members. This is especially true if the Physiologists
					facility continues to rely on the most standard and also the most
					inefficient manner of scheduling appointments over the phone.</p>
			</div>
			<div id="services_sec">
				<p>Picktime, an online appointment scheduling system, allows
					individuals to conveniently and securely book their appointments
					with Physiologists online through any Web-connected device. They
					can typically access Picktime through a “Book Now” button found on
					your website or page, or from an URL provided to them by the
					Physiologists. You appointments get automatically booked without
					any staff interaction needed. In addition to online scheduling,
					Picktime also comes equipped with other beneficial features like
					automated e-mail and text message reminders, which the system sends
					out to patients and booked individuals on a specific date prior to
					their scheduled appointment.</p>
			</div>
			<div id="services_sec">
				<p>Securing your information is our number one priority. Your
					data is backed up automatically and kept in ultra-secure
					facilities. Picktime is a robust Physiologist appointment
					scheduling software that is so easy to use. Take your practice to
					the next level, Picktime is the perfect application for all
					hospitals and doctor offices even if you are a one-man army or if
					you have multiple locations and multiple staff members. Allow your
					clients to schedule an appointment at their own convenience,
					remember that 60% of online bookings are made outside of office
					hours!</p>

					<p>By sending automatic reminders through email and SMS help
						your patients to keep their appointments and increase your
						revenue. It's a proven strategy to reduce no-shows by up to 70%.

						attend and results in much higher participation rates.
						Cancellations prior to the appointment enables you to reallocate
						appointment slots or redeploy your staff and resources. Picktime
						Appointment Reminder software improves your profits. Get
						organized!</p>
