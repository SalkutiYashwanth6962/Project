				<p>Over the past several years, online booking of tutoring lessons has been gaining prominence. Many parents are starting to choose online tutoring lessons booking over traditional ways of tutoring admission at learning centers. The open gate to online booking has given parents and students many options of tutors and institutions. Even if you have never used a tutor before, you may be familiar with the traditional in-person approach: you make an appointment, meet one-on-one or with a group, and receive assistance in a given subject. However, the advent of the Internet has changed this dynamic in several important ways. The digital format of online tutoring lends itself wonderfully to creating a permanent record of each session.</p>
