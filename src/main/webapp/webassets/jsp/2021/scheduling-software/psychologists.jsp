					<p>Have your patients engaged with your practice right from the
						start with our best-in-class client portal featuring completely
						paperless intakes and scheduling. Enjoy the flexibility and
						freedom of growing your practice without worrying about spending
						time on data entry, rescheduling, or appointment reminders.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="services_sec">
					<h3>Accessibility and Management</h3>
					<p>You can easily manage, edit, create and cancel bookings from
						your picktime calendar 24/7. This function will help you to
						control your appointments at any time. You can even specify the
						duration and the type of appointments you prefer to take. <a href="/features/class-bookings" target="_blank">Group
						bookings</a> are ideal for classes or family sessions where more than
						one client is attending. As it is a web-based appointment
						scheduling software, you can access it from laptops, smartphones,
						and tablets through the internet. Our Picktime appointment
						scheduling software has high standards for patient's data
						protection.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="services_sec">
					<h3>One calendar for your whole life</h3>
					<p>Whether you see a patient one time or every three weeks, we
						provide you with the flexibility to create a schedule that fits
						how you work. Non-client events(Staff Meetings, Lunch Breaks) are
						easily added to your calendar so you can manage your whole life
						from one place.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="services_sec">
					<h3>Sending automated notifications (Reduce No shows)</h3>
					<p>Our appointment booking software sends email and SMS
						notifications to your patients before the appointment as
						confirmation or as a reminder. You can preset appointment reminder
						before an appointment.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="services_sec">
					<h3>Appointment Booking on your Website</h3>
					<p>Your website can work for you in more ways than simply being
						an online support for your clients. Your website can also cut down
						on some of the administrative work and also act as an <a href="/" target="_blank">appointment
						scheduling tool</a> for your practice. Just place an embed code of
						your appointment scheduling page on your website. Now your website
						displays "Book Now" button on your website which allows your
						patients to book their appointments from your website.</p>
					<br>
					<p>Picktime will provide your customers with an outstanding
						scheduling experience. We encourage you to signup and take our
						Psychologists scheduling software for a test drive. You can even
						try it out with some of your clients to see their reaction. You
						will not be disappointed.</p>
