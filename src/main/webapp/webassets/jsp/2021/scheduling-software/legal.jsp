				<p>Why would a law practice be interested in an online booking system? Appointments with clients, opposing counsel, and colleagues are the lifeblood of your practice. It can also be very tedious. That's why we recommend a powerful online booking system for your legal firm. Your online booking system should allow your potential clients to choose the day and time that is right for them (and that works for you too, of course) and also, optionally, choose which attorney in your practice is available for them to meet.</p>

			        <p>Most of the lawyers use mobile devices more than a desktop and they are always on the move. Picktime offers a responsive web layout so that you do not miss any clients or meetings on the go. Whether you are at court or at Airport lounge, you can easily capture time and manage client matters, access your calendar and track deadlines.</p>

					<h3>No Website? No Problem</h3>

Display your logo, share your social media handles, and add your hours, location, services, and more. Best of all, it’s easy to set up, easier to maintain, and won’t take a penny out of your marketing budget.</p>

If you’re a solo practitioner or part of a small law firm, chances are your online appointment book is easily one of your most-used tools. But high-quality appointment-setting software can be much more than just a digital Rolex. If you’re using it at its full potential, it won’t just keep track of your leads, it’ll increase them.</p>
