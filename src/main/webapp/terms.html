			<p>PICKTIME WILL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY DAMAGES RESULTING FROM YOUR DISPLAYING, COPYING, OR DOWNLOADING ANY MATERIALS TO OR FROM THIS WEBSITE. IN NO EVENT WILL PICKTIME BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY INDIRECT, EXTRAORDINARY, EXEMPLARY,
			PUNITIVE, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING LOSS OF DATA, REVENUE, PROFITS, USE OR OTHER ECONOMIC ADVANTAGE) HOWEVER ARISING, EVEN IF WE KNOW THERE IS A POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.</p>	
			
			<p>PICKTIME’S MAXIMUM AGGREGATE LIABILITY TO YOU IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TERMS OR THE WEBSITE, REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF ACTION (WHETHER SUCH LIABILITY ARISES DUE TO NEGLIGENCE, BREACH OF CONTRACT, MISREPRESENTATION OR FOR ANY 
			OTHER REASON), WILL AT ALL TIMES BE LIMITED TO THE GREATER OF (I) THE AMOUNT PAID, IF ANY, BY YOU TO PICKTIME IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TERMS IN THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS PRIOR TO THE ACTION GIVING RISE TO LIABILITY OR (II) US $100.00.</p>		
		
			<h1 class="sub-title">LOCAL LAWS; EXPORT CONTROL</h1>
			<p>We control and operate this Website from our headquarters in the United States of America and the entirety of this Website may not be appropriate or available for use in other locations. If you use this Website outside the United States 
			of America, You are solely responsible for following applicable local laws.</p>	
			
			<h1 class="sub-title">FEEDBACK</h1>	
			<p>Any submissions by you to us (e.g., comments, questions, suggestions, materials – collectively, “Feedback”) through any communication whatsoever (e.g., call, fax, e-mail) will be treated as both non-confidential and non-proprietary.
			You hereby assign all right, title, and interest in, and we are free to use, without any attribution or compensation to you, any ideas, know-how, concepts, techniques, or other intellectual property and proprietary rights contained in
			the Feedback, whether or not patentable, for any purpose whatsoever, including but not limited to, developing, manufacturing, having manufactured, licensing, marketing, and selling, directly or indirectly, products and services using 
			such Feedback. You understand and agree that we are not obligated to use, display, reproduce, or distribute any such ideas, know-how, concepts, or techniques contained in the Feedback, and you have no right to compel such use, display,
			reproduction, or distribution.</p>		
			
			<h1 class="sub-title">DISPUTE RESOLUTION AND ARBITRATION; CLASS ACTION WAIVER.</h1>	
			<p>This provision facilitates the prompt and efficient resolution of any dispute (with the exception of the enforceability of the Class Action Waiver clause below) that may arise between you and us. Effectively, then, “dispute” is given
			the broadest meaning enforceable by law and includes any claims against other parties relating to services or products provided or billed to you (such as our licensors, suppliers, dealers or third-party vendors) whenever you also assert 
			claims against us in the same proceeding</p>	
				
			<p>This provision provides that all disputes between you and us will be resolved by binding arbitration because acceptance of these Terms constitutes a waiver of your right to litigation claims and all opportunity to be heard by a judge 
			or jury. We prefer this because we believe arbitration is less drama-filled than litigation. To be clear, there is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. The arbitrator must follow this
			agreement and can award the same damages and relief as a court (including attorney’s fees). You may, however, opt-out of this provision which means you would have a right or opportunity to bring claims in a court, before a judge or jury, 
			and/or to participate in or be represented in a case filed in court by others (including, but not limited to, class actions). YOU AND PICKTIME AGREE THAT, EXCEPT AS PROVIDED BELOW, ANY AND ALL DISPUTES, AS DEFINED ABOVE, WHETHER PRESENTLY
			IN EXISTENCE OR BASED ON ACTS OR OMISSIONS IN THE PAST OR IN THE FUTURE, WILL BE RESOLVED EXCLUSIVELY AND FINALLY BY BINDING ARBITRATION RATHER THAN IN COURT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS PROVISION.</p>		
		
			<p>Pre-Arbitration Claim Resolution</p>	
			
			<p>For all disputes, whether pursued in court or arbitration, you must first give us an opportunity to resolve the dispute which is first done by e-mailing us at hello@picktime.com the following information: (1) your name, (2) your address,
			(3) a written description of your claim, and (4) a description of the specific relief you seek. If we do not resolve the dispute within 45 days after receiving your notification, than you may pursue your dispute in arbitration. You may 
			pursue your dispute in a court only under the circumstances described below.</p>	
			
			<p>Exclusions from Arbitration/Right to Opt Out</p>	
			
			<p>Notwithstanding the above, you or we may choose to pursue a dispute in court and not by arbitration if: (a) the dispute qualifies for initiation in small claims court; or (b) YOU OPT-OUT OF THESE ARBITRATION PROCEDURES WITHIN 30 DAYS 
			FROM THE DATE THAT YOU FIRST CONSENT TO THIS AGREEMENT (the “Opt-Out Deadline”). You may opt-out of this provision by e-mailing us at hello@picktime.com the following information: (1) your name; (2) your address; (3) a clear statement that
			you do not wish to resolve disputes with us through arbitration. Either way, we will not take any decision you make personally. In fact, we promise that your decision to opt-out of this Arbitration Provision will have no adverse effect on
			your relationship with us. But, we do have to enforce the Opt-Out Deadline so keep in mind that any opt-out request received after the Opt-Out Deadline will not be valid and you must pursue your dispute in arbitration or small claims court.</p>	
		
			<p>Arbitration Procedures</p>	
			
			<p>If this provision applies and the dispute is not resolved as provided above (Pre-Arbitration Claim Resolution) either you or we may initiate arbitration proceedings. The American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), www.adr.org, or JAMS, 
			www.jamsadr.com, will arbitrate all disputes, and the arbitration will be conducted before a single arbitrator. The arbitration will be commenced as an individual arbitration, and will in no event be commenced as a class arbitration. 
			This provision governs in the event it conflicts with the applicable arbitration rules. Under no circumstances will class action procedures or rules apply to the arbitration. Because this Website and these Terms concern interstate
			commerce, the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”) governs the arbitrability of all disputes. However, the arbitrator will apply applicable substantive law consistent with the FAA and the applicable statute of limitations or condition precedent
			to suit. You or we may initiate arbitration in either Georgia or the federal judicial district that includes your billing address. In the event that you select the latter, we may transfer the arbitration to Georgia so long as we agree to 
			pay any additional fees or costs which the arbitrator determines you incur as a result of the transfer. So long as you place a request in writing prior to commencement of the arbitration, we will pay all arbitration fees and associated costs
			and expenses. But, you will still be responsible for all additional fees and costs that you incur in the arbitration which include but are not limited to attorneys’ fees or expert witnesses.</p>	
			
			<p>Pre-Arbitration Claim Resolution</p>	
			
			<p>For all disputes, whether pursued in court or arbitration, you must first give us an opportunity to resolve the dispute which is first done by e-mailing us at hello@picktime.com the following information: (1) your name, (2) your address,
			(3) a written description of your claim, and (4) a description of the specific relief you seek. If we do not resolve the dispute within 45 days after receiving your notification, than you may pursue your dispute in arbitration. You may 
			pursue your dispute in a court only under the circumstances described below.</p>	
			
			<p>Class Action Waiver</p>	
			
			<p>Except as otherwise provided in this provision, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a class or representative proceeding or claims (such as a class action,
			consolidated action or private attorney general action) unless both you and Picktime specifically agree to do so following initiation of the arbitration. If you choose to pursue your dispute in court by opting out of the Arbitration 
			Provision, as specified above, this Class Action Waiver will not apply to you. Neither you, nor any other user of this Website can be a class representative, class member, or otherwise participate in a class, consolidated, or
			representative proceeding without having complied with the opt-out requirements above.</p>	
			
			<p>Other</p>
			
			<p>You understand and agree that by accepting this provision in these Terms, you and we are each waiving the right to a jury trial or a trial before a judge in a public court. If any clause within this provision (other than the Class 
			Action Waiver clause above) is found to be illegal or unenforceable, that clause will be severed from this provision whose remainder will be given full force and effect. If the Class Action Waiver clause is found to be illegal or unenforceable,
			this entire provision will be unenforceable and the dispute will be decided by a court. This provision will survive the termination of your account with us or our affiliates and your discontinued use of this Website. Notwithstanding any 
			provision in this Agreement to the contrary, we agree that if we make any change to this provision (other than a change to the Notice Address), you may reject any such change and require us to adhere to the language in this provision if a 
			dispute between us arises.</p>
			
			<h1 class="sub-title">GENERAL TERMS</h1>
			<p>We think direct communication resolves most issues – if we feel that you are not complying with these Terms, We will tell you. We will even provide you with recommended necessary corrective action(s) if possible. However, certain
			violations of these Terms, as determined by us, may require immediate termination of your access to this Website without prior notice to you. The Federal Arbitration Act, Georgia state law and applicable U.S. federal law, without regard 
			to the choice or conflicts of law provisions, will govern these Terms. Foreign laws do not apply. Except for disputes subject to arbitration as described above, any disputes relating to these Terms or this Website will be heard in the 
			courts located in Fulton County, Georgia. If any of these Terms are deemed inconsistent with applicable law, then such term(s) will be interpreted to reflect the intentions of the parties, and no other terms will be modified. By choosing
			not to enforce any of these Terms, we are not waiving our rights. These Terms are the entire agreement between you and us and, therefore, supersede all prior or contemporaneous negotiations, discussions or agreements between Picktime
			and you about this Website. The rights of Picktime under our Terms will survive the termination of our Terms.</p>
			
			<h1 class="sub-title">CHANGES</h1>
			<p>We may amend our Terms at any time by publishing revised Terms on our Website and/or by sending an e-mail to the address you gave us. The latest copies of our Terms will be posted on our Website, and you should review all Terms prior
			to using our Website. Continued use of this Website following notice of any such modifications indicates you acknowledge and agree to be bound by the modifications. Therefore, it is important for you to periodically review our Terms to
			make sure you still agree to them. If you object to any such modifications, your sole recourse will be to cease using this Website. Picktime reserves the right to change any and all features of our Website, at any time without notice.</p>
